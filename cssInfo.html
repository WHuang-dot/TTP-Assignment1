        <h1>CSS Introduction</h1>
        <p>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.</p>
        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
            <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, 
            including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h2>CSS Example</h2>
            <img class = "example-image" src="images/css_tutorial.png" alt="Css code">
        </div>

        <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
        <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p>
        <p>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:</p>
        <p>&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
        <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        <p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, 
            it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, 
            became a long and expensive process.</p>
        <p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
        <p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
        <p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
        <p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
