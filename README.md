# TTP-Assignment1

This is our take on Assignment #1 for the TTP cohort, where we built and hosted a simple informational website about HTML and CSS.

Even though we are relatively new to HTML and CSS, we were able to learn and build a website in a matter of two days.

We know that we still have tons of room for improvement for the website, and we will take that in our mind!

Very excited to learn more and build from here!
